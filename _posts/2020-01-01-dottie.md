Dottie is a docile Dumeril's Boa, who is full-size at 7 feet long! She is a non-venomous
constrictor. We were generously given her in 2014 from another zoo where she was no longer
needed. They adopted her from someone who didn't know how old she was. However, when we got her,
she was full-grown and was a successful breeder, so she had to be at least five years old, and
is probably much older! Dottie likes to bask under her heat lamp, hide in her box, and eat rats.
When out for "walks", this older sit-and-wait predator likes to find new hiding spots.
