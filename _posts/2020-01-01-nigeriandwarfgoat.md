Juliana Pig is a new breed of small domestic pig, similar to the Vietnamese Pot Belly Pig. Piglets of this breed are often what people call teacup, mini, or micro pigs. They do remain much smaller than a farm hog, and stand at only 13-18" tall. However, when this breed is fully grown and is not malnourished, it can grow to 100-250 lbs. We have two female Juliana pigs, born in January 2020. At 8 weeks of age they were already 25 pounds! Their names are Caeleste and Luna, which are Latin for Celestial and the Moon. Caeleste has a star-shaped spot on her head, and Luna has a moon-shaped spot on hers.
