Juliana Pig is a new breed of small domestic pig, similar to the Vietnamese Pot Belly Pig. Piglets of this breed are often what people call teacup, mini, or micro pigs. They do remain much smaller than a farm hog, and stand at only 13-18" tall. However, when this breed is fully grown and is fed appropriately, adults are around 100 lbs, and can grow up to 200 lbs at a healthy weight. We have two female Juliana pigs, born in January 2020. At 8 weeks of age they were already 25 pounds! Their names are Caeleste and Luna, which are Latin for Celestial and the Moon. Caeleste has a star-shaped spot on her head, and Luna has a moon-shaped spot on hers. They are extremely intelligent and constantly getting into things.
