**Squirmy McCoil** is a Rubber Boa who was born in captivity in 2015, and his species is from here
in Washington! He is non-venomous, yet not a constrictor. He was donated to us as a baby by a
generous breeder, when he was the size of an earthworm! Since then he has grown to 1.5 feet,
and is likely full-size. He likes to burrow in soil, hide in his log, and eat mice. When he is
being held, he likes to find a warm dark place to hang out, like up a sleeve!
