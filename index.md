      We are an educational traveling zoo based in Olympia, WA that brings
      exotic and domestic animals to various locations within the Puget Sound
      Area of Washington State to provide interactive, educational, hands-on
      programs. We specialize in Birthday Parties and Schools, but can do
      presentations for almost any group!
