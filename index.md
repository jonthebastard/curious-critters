      We are an educational traveling zoo based in Olympia, WA that brings
      exotic and domestic animals to various locations within the Puget Sound
      Area of Washington State to provide interactive, educational, hands-on
      programs. We specialize in Birthday Parties and Schools, but can do
      presentations for almost any group!
      <br><br>
      In our typical presentation, each animal is brought around the room
      one at a time, so that participants can get an up-close view! The
      majority of the animals can also be touched by all participants, if
      they so desire. This presentation style ensures maximum safety for
      the participants and our animals, while allowing intimate interaction
      between the humans and animals.
