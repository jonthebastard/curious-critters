      This is similar to a therapy dog program, but with many kinds of animals!
      We will bring 3 of our friendly animals to your community, where we will
      have an engaging discussion with the members and give everyone a chance to
      pet and bond with each animal. While being entertained by the antics of
      the critters, they can learn about different topics such as pet care,
      animal training, parental care, trauma, emotional intelligence, local
      wildlife, and environmental impact. You can choose the topics that are
      most relevant to your group. The animals will teach them more about
      themselves than they thought possible! â€‹

      Your community members who used to have a cat, rabbit, reptile, or
      other exotic pet will readily bond with our animals. Ones who haven't
      bonded with pets before will have the opportunity to learn to empathize
      with another species. The educator can give information and lend an
      empathetic ear, but is not a licensed therapist. Our animal friends do the
      therapy and healing just by being themselves and interacting with people!
      These are great programs to do regularly, such as once/week, with troubled
      youth or the elderly. This allows members to develop relationships with
      the animals, get more comfortable with them, and share their own
      stories.
