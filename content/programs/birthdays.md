      Does your little one have a birthday coming up? We can help make it the
      most memorable birthday yet- with the antics of our animals! We will bring
      5 or more of our amazing animals to your house or party location, and give
      every guest a chance to touch EACH one! The kids will have a blast during
      our interactive presentation while learning fun facts about the critters!

      The birthday child will even get to have their picture taken while holding
      an exotic animal*, and will get a special gift! We always bring a variety
      of at least 5 animals, but we can bring an extra animal you choose for
      $50!


      Presentation is for one hour, up to 30 participants. Additional adults are
      welcome to attend and watch. Can be held indoors in small or large spaces,
      or outdoors in warm weather. 


      \* Presenter will allow the birthday child to hold an animal at their sole
      discretion, depending on the situation at hand, to ensure the safety of
      the animal and child. If presenter decides that allowing the child to hold
      the animal is risky, the presenter will hold or position the animal next
      to the child for the photo. The camera and photographer are to be provided
      by the guardians of the child. All photos posted on social media by the
      participants must be attributed to "Curious Critters by Casai" or hash
      tagged as #curiouscrittersbycasai. 


      Birthday Party Presentation includes all your entertainment for a party of
      up to 30 guests, [all for a low fee](/content/programs/program-fees)!
