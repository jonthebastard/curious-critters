      We will bring exotic, safe animals to your school for the kids to touch!
      Presentations of the animals include engaging group discussions and
      hands-on activities. Just tell us the grade level and topic or standards
      you want to cover, and we will tailor a program to your group! Programs
      are designed to fit into a normal class period for up to 35 students, and
      can be done back-to-back for multiple classes. We offer a discount for
      multiple programs in the same location. We always bring a variety of at
      least four animals, but we can bring an extra mystery animal for $50! 


      ## This is the general presentation guideline for all grades:


      Students will observe and touch 4 animals from these groups: reptile,
      mammal, bird, amphibian, insect or other arthropod. We have a fun,
      engaging discussion where students draw on their visual, tactile, and
      auditory observations to answer and ask questions. We focus on grade
      appropriate topics of Life Science and Earth Science in the Next
      Generation Science Standards, which their school teacher can choose. We
      engage in hands-on activities that incorporate several Science and
      Engineering Practices, as well as ELA and Mathematics Standards to
      investigate scientific concepts and learn more about the animals. We can
      accommodate requests from the teacher for specific standards that they
      would like their class to work on. The students will practice skills in
      Language Arts and Mathematics, as well as Science and Engineering, in
      order to master several Disciplinary Core Ideas.

      ## Here are some examples of programs we do:


      ### Kindergarten: Finding Resources


      Students will observe and touch 4 animals from these groups: reptile,
      mammal, bird, amphibian, insect or other arthropod! We have a fun
      discussion where students will answer and ask questions about how the
      animals find and obtain food, water, shelter, and air from their
      environment. We look at a model of an animal or an artifact and compare it
      to the live animal. Students will watch an animal breathing, and if the
      animals cooperate, they will also observe an animal eating or finding
      shelter! They will model behaviors observed, through dramatization. After
      the lesson, they will be able to use their observations to describe how
      animals get resources and name the animal's body parts on a picture. 


      Standards this program helps students achieve:


      NGSS K-LS1-1
      <br>K-ESS2-2
      <br>K-ESS3-1
      <br>K-ESS3-3


      CCSS.ELA-LITERACY.SL.K.1
      <br>SL.K.2
      <br>SL.K.3
      <br>SL.K.5
      <br>SL.K.6


      CCSS.MATH.CONTENT.K.MD.A.1
      <br>K.MD.A.2


      ### 1st grade: Survival


      Students will observe and touch 4 animals from these groups: reptile,
      mammal, bird, amphibian, insect or other arthropod! We have an engaging
      discussion where students will answer and ask questions about what
      adaptations and structures animals use to obtain food, water, shelter, and
      air, and what behaviors they do to ensure their offspring survive. They
      will touch an artifact from an animal which demonstrates an adaptation for
      survival! The educator will show pictures of animals' parents and students
      will verbally compare features to the offspring. After the lesson, they
      will be able to describe patterns in the body parts and behaviors the
      animals use to obtain resources and help offspring. They will be able to
      use their observations to draw an account of similarities and differences
      between parents and offspring. 


      Standards this program helps students achieve:


      NGSS 1-LS1-1
      <br>1-LS1-2
      <br>1-LS3-1


      CCSS.ELA-LITERACY.SL.1.1
      <br>SL.1.2
      <br>SL.1.3
      <br>SL.1.5


      W.1.8


      CCSS.MATH.CONTENT.1.MD.C.4
      <br>1.G.A.1


      Programs are designed for a class of up to 35 students for 1 hour, all for
      [a low fee](/content/programs/program-fees)!
