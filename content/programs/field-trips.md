      Take your class on a hassle-free field trip to a nearby park, beach, pond,
      or wooded area, with our educator as your personal nature guide! We can do
      this in almost any open space, even one your class can walk to, because
      biodiversity abounds everywhere! Students will explore the details of the
      sights, sounds, feel, smell, and even taste of nature with a knowledgeable
      guide. Observing the interconnectedness of living things and the
      environment first hand, students will learn to identify and describe
      adaptations and structures of living things and their functions for
      survival. They will break into groups to measure and plot a transect in a
      habitat. In that study plot, they will identify and count all the living
      things they can find, recording their data. 


      [Tell us](/content/contact) what grade level and Life Science or Earth Science

      for 2 hours, all for [a low fee](/content/programs/program-fees)!
