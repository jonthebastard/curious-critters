      Do you want a unique photo booth for your event? Are you a photographer?
      Do you film commercials, TV, or movies? You could include our live exotic
      animals in your pictures!


      An animal handler will bring a critter or two of your choice to have your
      models pose with. Depending upon the animal, they might even be able to
      hold the animal for the photos! Imagine your models holding a 7 foot boa!


      If you're having a party, fair, or similar
      [event](/content/programs/events), we can set up a photo booth so that
      your attendees can get pics of themselves posing with an animal! We will
      handle the booth, backdrop, basic lighting, and animal handling. Animal
      handler can not be a photographer. You can provide your own camera and
      photographer, or we can provide a professional photographer with camera
      for an additional fee. 


      For video shoots, we often can accommodate requests for an animal doing a
      specific behavior or posing/moving in a certain way. Some of our animals
      are trained, so for example, if you want a bunny to hop across the screen
      and jump in a basket, we can probably make that happen, so [just ask
      us!](/content/contact) 


      â€‹[Contact us](/content/contact) to discuss animal options, details, and
      [pricing](/content/programs/program-fees).
