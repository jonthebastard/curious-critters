      Does your little one have a birthday coming up? We can help make it the
      most memorable birthday yet! We will bring 4 or more of our amazing
      animals to your house or party location, where we will tell the attendees
      about the animals and give everyone a chance to touch each one. Children
      will delight in watching an animal roam around the room! While being
      entertained by the antics of the animals, they may even learn some fun
      facts about topics such as pet care, animal training, parental care, local
      wildlife, and the environment we share. You can choose which topic you
      want them to learn about most.



      Through the interactive presentation, the
      kids will have a blast acting like animals, and you'll learn more than
      you thought you could at a birthday party! The birthday child will even
      get to have their picture taken while holding an exotic animal\*, and will
      get a special gift!  Presentation is for one hour, up to 30 participants.
      Additional adults are welcome to attend and watch. Can be held indoors or
      outdoors in warm weather. We always bring a variety of at least four
      animals, but we can bring an extra mystery animal for $50!



      \* Presenter will allow the birthday child to hold an animal at their sole
      discretion, depending on the situation at hand, to ensure the safety of
      the animal and child. If presenter decides that allowing the child to hold
      the animal is risky, the presenter will hold or position the animal next
      to the child for the photo. The camera and photographer are to be provided
      by the guardians of the child. All photos posted on social media by the
      participants must be attributed to "Curious Critters by Casai" or hash
      tagged as #curiouscrittersbycasai. 



      Birthday Party Presentation is designed for a group of up to 30
      participants for 1 hour, [all for a low fee](/content/programs/program-fees)!
