      Up to 35 participants can enjoy an interactive 1 hour presentation of fun
      facts where they all have the opportunity to touch at least 4 of our
      exotic animals!


      We also do exploration-based programs where we use the variety of
      organisms participants find, in order to teach them about various topics.
      This is like a guided nature walk with scientific inquiry!


      If you have an event, fair, or conference, we can set up a booth with live
      animals on display!
