- name: Coraline
  bio: |
    Coraline is a 5 lb. mixed breed domestic rabbit. We adopted her at about 4 years of age in 2012.
    She had a history of chronic upper respiratory and ear infections. Her previous owners didn't
    treat her infections, and allowed them to get so bad that her right facial nerve was damaged.
    This means that her right ear, lips, and cheek are now paralyzed, and her cheek muscles are
    contracted, giving her a cute smirk. This doesn't seem to bother her at all, and she does all her
    normal bunny behaviors. The only differences are that she makes cute slurping noises when she
    drinks, she snores when she sleeps, and she listens to you with one ear forward! After we got
    her, she got infection after infection, which we treated, but couldn’t find the underlying
    cause. Eventually the vet figured out that she had a diseased tooth hidden in her molars, which
    could be harboring bacteria! After three surgeries, he was able to remove the tooth and the
    source of the infections. Now that she is healthy, she is so much happier! Her favorite
    activities are zooming around, chasing cats, eating, throwing her heavy dish around when it's
    empty, nibbling things that are in her way, and dancing for treats!

- name: Alejandro
  bio: |
    Alejandro is a Flemish Giant Rabbit mix, weighing in at a healthy 9.5 lbs, which is smaller than
    a pure bred Flemish giant! He had been found running around loose a little while after Easter. It
    is a common practice for people to get a baby bunny for Easter for their children. When that bunny
    outgrows the cage or hutch, or the child gets bored of it and stops taking care of it, the parents
    “free” the bunny at a nearby park. There it is likely to get hit by a car, eaten by a hawk, or
    attacked by a dog! We adopted him at about 1 year of age in 2016. He loves to binky (jump for joy,
    or frolic), explore, chew on things, and get petted. He adores Coraline, and shows it by snuggling
    and grooming her whenever she allows it. He is doing agility training and loves to jump through a
    hoop for treats!

- name: Dottie
  bio: |
    Dottie is a docile Dumeril's Boa, who is full-size at 7 feet long! She is a non-venomous
    constrictor. We were generously given her in 2014 from another zoo where she was no longer
    needed. They adopted her from someone who didn't know how old she was. However, when we got her,
    she was full-grown and was a successful breeder, so she had to be at least five years old, and
    is probably much older! Dottie likes to bask under her heat lamp, hide in her box, and eat rats.
    When out for "walks", this older sit-and-wait predator likes to find new hiding spots.

- name: Squirmy McCoil
  bio: |
    Squirmy McCoil is a Rubber Boa who was born in captivity in 2015, and his species is from here
    in Washington! He is non-venomous, yet not a constrictor. He was donated to us as a baby by a
    generous breeder, when he was the size of an earthworm! Since then he has grown to 1.5 feet,
    and is likely full-size. He likes to burrow in soil, hide in his log, and eat mice. When he is
    being held, he likes to find a warm dark place to hang out, like up a sleeve!

- name: Trogdor
  bio: |
    Trogdor is a Green Iguana, born in 2010, and already full size at 6 feet long, including his
    tail! He's a very handsome male with large sub-tympanic shields, and a lot of spikes along
    his back. His first owner didn't give him the proper UVA and UVB lights, which led to him
    developing metabolic bone disease, a common issue in pet iguanas. After being painstakingly
    rehabilitated and regaining his health, he grew like a weed! You may notice that his jaw is
    misaligned as a result of the MBD. This is not much of a problem, except that while sleeping
    his mouth falls open so that the tip of his tongue hangs out! He loves to get misted, get
    scratches from his human caretakers, and eat a nice salad. When the weather is warm he also
    loves to go outside for walks and to soak up the sun!
