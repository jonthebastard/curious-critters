      **Owner**


      Casai has always loved everything about nature, and started learning about
      it at an early age from her older brother, who was a marine biologist. He
      gave her Purple Knight Land Crabs, which started a succession of numerous
      pets. Since childhood, she has rescued animals in need of homes or
      rehabilitation. At the University of Connecticut, Casai studied animal
      behavior, worked in a neuroscience lab, and researched insects,
      culminating in a BS in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology. After an
      internship at the American Museum of Natural History and working in bird
      conservation for New York State Parks, she realized that office work
      wasnâ€™t for her, but found an interest in Environmental Education. She
      worked as an Educator at The Maritime Aquarium, teaching a huge variety of
      science programs, developing curricula, designing experiments to do with
      kids, and teaching touch tank programs with intertidal animals! She loved
      it, but wanted to do educational programs with a larger variety of live
      animals, especially ones which were trainable. After working for a small
      traveling zoo as a keeper for a while, she realized gaining more
      experience first would help her be more successful. To maximize her
      learning, she did a series of internships at various zoos in California,
      caring for animals, training animals, and teaching. This led to working
      for the San Francisco Zoo teaching traveling educational programs with a
      large variety of exotic animals, and loving it! From those vast and varied
      experiences, she knew that creating her own traveling zoo in order to
      teach kids about the environment was her calling. After years of learning
      about business, regulations, and other preparatory work, she started
      Curious Critters by Casai!

          In every program, we teach the public about their impact on the
          environment and how they can conserve it. We inspire passion for
          wildlife and foster a sense of stewardship. As a long term goal, we
          will support and participate in conservation programs as well as
          international field conservation.

          We reduce, reuse and recycle, and have a permaculture farm to supply
          food to the animals and to process their waste. We make every effort
          to respect the environment in our operations.The majority of our
          animals arerescuedor adopted, and we avoid purchasing animals from
          breeders.

          We provide hands-on experiences with fauna and nature to local
          inhabitants, expanding their knowledge of the world around them. We

          living things, and connect with their larger community.

          nutrition,veterinary care, enrichment, clean spacious enclosures,

          The comfort and safety of our animals and participants is our utmost
          concern. We design our programs, interaction styles, sanitization
          practices, travel distances, and travel carriers to maximize safety
          and reduce stress for all involved.

      Curious Critters by Casai was started in 2016 as a sole proprietorship. We
      are transitioning to a non-profit organization to better serve the needs
      of our community. Through interactive, hands-on educational programs with
      live animals, we inspire the public to learn, develop passion, and act as
      environmental stewards.   We envision a world in which the public are
      familiar with the natural world around them and are good stewards,
      engaging in sustainable practices. We inspire and encourage the next
      generations of wildlife stewards to learn about nature and the simple
      actions they can take to help preserve it.
